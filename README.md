# Mexican AIbuelita

### Inspiration

One evening, amongst friends, a debate arose. A bold claim: there's a universal salsa for every dish! We scoffed. Pairing salsa with food is an art, as intricate as cheese and wine. To make matters worse, the "universal" salsa turned out to be a store-bought imposter. We, fueled by passion for authentic flavors, decided to create a solution â€“ Mexican AI Buelita.

### What it Does

Meet AI Buelita, your friendly, AI-powered Mexican grandmother (abuelita) in chatbot form. AI Buelita utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to craft personalized salsa recipes based on your preferences:

- **Spicyness:** Do you crave a fiery salsa or a mild dip?

- **Ease of Preparation:** Short on time? AI Buelita has options!

- **Dish Pairing:** The heart of the matter! Tell AI Buelita what you're cooking, and she'll suggest the perfect salsa complement.

AI Buelita consults a curated library of mouthwatering, traditional salsa recipes. By analyzing the user's  inputs and recipe descriptions, she recommends the most fitting salsa for your culinary creation.

### Challenges Faced

Unearthing authentic recipes proved difficult. Abuelitas are notoriously protective of their culinary secrets!
